        <h3 class="pageDetailTitle">Trials of Mana's Best Change Will Also Be Its Most Controversial</h3>
        <ul class="pageDetailNews">
            <li>MAR 16, 2020</li>
            <li>BY ZAK WOJNAR</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="pageDetailContent">
            <img src="../images/newsDetailImg1.jpg"><br /><br />
            <p><strong><em>Trials of Mana</em></strong> contains many additions and changes to the original <em>Seiken
                    Densetsu 3</em>, many of which are sure to be warmly received by most players. However, there's one
                change that will inevitably drive an outspoken minority to the brink of madness. Originally released on
                Super Nintendo back in 1995, <em>Seiken Densetsu 3</em> was never brought over to the West during its
                initial run. That changed with the 2019 release of <a href="#"><em>Collection of Mana</em></a>, which
                bundled the game with ports of its predecessors, <em>Final Fantasy Adventure</em> and <em>Secret of
                    Mana</em>. Now, the retitled <em>Trials of Mana</em> is getting a full 3D remake for modern
                consoles, and we got to play the first two hours at a recent press event in New York City.</p><br />
            <p>In contrast to the 2D sprites of the original, <em>Trials of Mana</em> is a fully 3D game. Unlike the
                previous remakes of <em>Secret of Mana</em> and <em>Final Fantasy Adventure</em> (which was retitled
                <em>Adventures of Mana</em> for its 3D incarnation), the new <em>Trials of Mana</em> doesn't just update
                the visuals to 3D while leaving the original gameplay untouched; <a href="#">this is a full-on
                    remake</a>, with new combat mechanics, full camera control mapped to the right stick, and numerous
                other changes, large and small.</p><br />
            <p>While it's certainly not the biggest addition made to the game, there's one new change that's sure to
                trigger a particular group of old-school hardcore gamers: waypoints. <em>Trials of Mana</em> now always
                uses map icons to direct the player to the next destination to move the story forward. Obviously, this
                change was made to make the game <a href="#">more accessible to players</a> who might otherwise get lost
                amidst the large towns and occasionally obtuse quest design. Still, it's a guarantee that certain fans
                of the original <em>Seiken Densetsu 3</em> will be absolutely livid at the prospect of the game holding
                players' hands in such a direct fashion.</p>
